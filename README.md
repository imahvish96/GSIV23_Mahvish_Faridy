2. Collect Coverage using ```npm run coverage```.

## Elements Done Well

In this project, I've demonstrated my proficiency in several ways:

1. **Redux Toolkit Integration:** I've used Redux Toolkit for state management. By utilizing its simplified syntax, I've effectively managed the application's global state, actions, reducers, showcasing my proficiency in modern state management techniques.

2. **React Router v6 Usage:** I've implemented routing using React Router v6. This allows for dynamic routing and navigation within the app while taking advantage of the latest routing features provided by React Router. I have create a routing folder we i have manger to configure base routing.

3. **Component Structure:** I've organized the components into a logical structure, adhering to best practices for component-based development. This enhances code maintainability and readability.

4. **API Integration with Axios:** I've used Axios to make API requests to fetch movie data. This demonstrates my ability to handle asynchronous operations and integrate external data sources into the app.

5. **Testing with Jest and React Testing Library:** I've included unit tests for key components using Jest and React Testing Library. This indicates my commitment to writing robust and testable code.

6. **Integration of React Icons:** I've integrated React Icons to enhance the visual appeal of the app. This showcases my ability to incorporate third-party libraries and improve the user interface. As provied in guids i have only used material icons. Reason i have used the react-icon package to just make it simple and without adding material-ui library bundle.

## Potential Improvements

If I had an additional 4 hours, I would focus on the following improvements:

1. **Enhanced UI/UX:** I would dedicate time to refining the user interface, adding animations, transitions, and optimizing the layout to create a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

2. **Error Handling:** I would implement comprehensive error handling for API requests and unexpected scenarios. This would provide users with better feedback in case of errors.

3. **Integration Testing:** I would expand the test suite to include integration tests to ensure that various parts of the app work seamlessly together.

4. **Accessibility Improvements:** I would ensure the app adheres to accessibility standards, making it usable for a wider audience.

## Feedback

The challenge was a great opportunity to showcase my skills with the specified libraries. Adding a real-world scenario or user stories to the challenge could make it even more engaging and valuable for assessing practical proficiency.

Thank you for the chance to complete this challenge!
